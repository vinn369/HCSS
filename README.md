 Due to busy life style we can't remember all confidential data like All maid Id, Password, All bank account no, Insurance policy No, PAN NO, Driving License No, Password Port No, All education certificate Numbers, Some highly value scan copy, some confidential photo and music, videos. It is a software locker which can hold user sign in information, much like the functionality of SSO, however one can also couple a biometric hardware to strengthen the security system. The system will help user in logging in to the client system for which it is holding/storing the password, either by the software interface or directly by hardware interface. So we can develop highly security web application (new security algorithm and hardware system) .so we can store all confidential data in single credentials.
